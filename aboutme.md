I am a polymer chemist by training, although my interests are broad and vast. My doctorate was titled "Sustainable Cross-linked Polymers with Potential for Recyclability." In recent years, I have become more passionate about digital technologies, particularly AI and machine learning. I am currently taking an online course about using python for data science.
