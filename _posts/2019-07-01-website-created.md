This is my first post on the new website. Thank you for visiting my page! I also want to give a special thanks to [Dean Attali](https://deanattali.com/), who created the website template that I am currently using.

## Purpose
I plan to use this website to maintain my personal brand. I am also in the process of learning python to use in data science. I will post progress I make here, especially any projects that I undertake.
